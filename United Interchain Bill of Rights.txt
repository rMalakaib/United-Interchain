United Interchain Bill of Rights

___________________________________________________________________
While the Bill of Rights may begin sparsely, we chose to maintain simplicity as wise politicians are 
cautious about including laws or rules that are to be broken by necessity. We hope the whole interchain 
community will contribute to the start that humbly presents itself in front of them.

The Bill of Rights will be subject to iterations and should not be considered finalized until the 
interchain reaches a consensus on the contents.

It is our right and duty to alter and institute a new government and to halt the abuses of the 
corporate and governmental banking system duopoly. We do not recall a time when the citizenry of the 
globe experienced life free of monetary dominion - The illusion of freedom grips the world today. We 
have subjected ourselves to central tyranny for decades. We do not know true freedom; as such, it is 
our obligation and responsibility to lay a new foundation that will affect our happiness and liberty.

We hold these truths to be self-evident that all people and ledgers are equal and endowed with 
unalienable rights; among these are privacy, liberty, and the pursuit of equal opportunity. To 
ensure these rights the government is implemented among the people, deriving their powers from the 
consent of the governed. At any period the government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the 
charge of the people to fork or alter it and form a more perfect national body. To achieve the axiomatic 
rights we deem unalienable, we desire, no, require, Union to protect our system of governance from 
internal and external malady, coordinate progress towards monetary freedom, and maintain the Interchain. 
Only then, when we marshal interchain cooperation, will we accomplish monetary freedom and, thereby, true 
individual liberty.

Found below is the beginning of our rights. While it may begin sparsely, we chose to maintain 
simplicity as wise politicians are cautious about including laws or rules that are to be broken by 
necessity. We hope the whole interchain community will contribute to the start that humbly presents 
itself in front of them.

1) The Interchain Congress shall make no law respecting religion, speech, code, press, or right to fork.
2) Individuals have the right to life, privacy, private keys, liberty, data, and property.
3) Ledgers have the right to privacy, private keys, liberty, data, and property.
4) No chain shall deprive any person of liberty, property, data, or privacy without due process of law, 
nor deny any person or ledger within its jurisdiction the equal protection of laws.
5) Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment on ledgers or individuals 
inflicted.

The bill of rights will be subject to iterations and should not be considered finalized until the 
interchain reaches a consensus on the contents.
